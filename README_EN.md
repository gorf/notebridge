# notebridge

Just like the old saying "eating at one house, sleeping at another," I can't give up the features of either Joplin or Obsidian, so I created this command-line tool to help you achieve bidirectional synchronization between Joplin and Obsidian notes. This is currently a rough initial version.

---

## Tool Introduction

notebridge allows you to easily synchronize all note content between Joplin and Obsidian on Windows, including:
- Titles
- Body text
- Tags
- Attachments (images, PDFs, etc.)
- Folder structure
- Selective sync support (certain notebooks can be synced one-way or skipped)
- Sync direction control (bidirectional, unidirectional)
- **Reliable ID-based identification**: Uses `notebridge_id` to ensure note consistency, unaffected by filename changes

You just need to enter one command in the terminal, and the tool will automatically keep both sides in sync.

## Installation

1. Install Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
2. Download the project code.
3. In the command line, navigate to the project folder and run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Before first use, simple configuration is required:

1. **Joplin Settings**
   - Open Joplin, go to Settings → Web Clipper → Enable Web Clipper service.
   - Note down the "Port" and "Token".
2. **Obsidian Settings**
   - Find your Obsidian vault folder path.
3. **Create Config File**
   - Create `config.json` in the project root directory with example content:
     ```json
     {
       "joplin": {
         "api_base": "http://127.0.0.1:41184",
         "token": "your_joplin_token"
       },
       "obsidian": {
         "vault_path": "C:/Users/your_username/Obsidian_vault_path"
       },
       "sync_rules": {
         "joplin_to_obsidian_only": ["Work Notes", "Temp Notes"],
         "obsidian_to_joplin_only": ["Personal Diary"],
         "skip_sync": ["Drafts", "Test"],
         "bidirectional": ["Study Notes", "Project Docs"]
       }
     }
     ```

### Sync Mode Explanation

#### Automatic Sync Mode
- **Bidirectional sync** (default): Mutual sync between Joplin and Obsidian
- **Joplin → Obsidian**: Only sync from Joplin to Obsidian, suitable for initial import
- **Obsidian → Joplin**: Only sync from Obsidian to Joplin, suitable for backup

#### Manual Confirmation Mode (Recommended)
**Why is manual confirmation mode recommended?**
- ✅ **Prevents duplicate headers**: Automatically checks and fixes duplicate sync info headers before each sync
- ✅ **Prevents reverse sync**: Automatically detects note source, avoids syncing notes back to their origin (e.g., Obsidian → Joplin → Obsidian)
- ✅ **Intelligent deletion detection**: Uses sync time and cached state to automatically determine if a note was deleted or is new
- ✅ **Enhanced deletion handling**: Provides options to delete locally or copy to the other side
- ✅ **Complete control**: Shows details for each note before sync, you decide whether to sync
- ✅ **Safe and reliable**: Can view note content, sync status, duplicate headers, note source, etc. anytime
- ✅ **Flexible operations**: Supports skip single, skip all, exit, etc.

**Use Cases:**
- Recommended for first-time sync
- First sync after resolving duplicate header issues
- When uncertain which notes need syncing
- When careful inspection of each note is needed

### Selective Sync Configuration

In `config.json`, you can configure sync rules for different notebooks (supports wildcard pattern matching):

- `joplin_to_obsidian_only`: Only sync from Joplin to Obsidian
- `obsidian_to_joplin_only`: Only sync from Obsidian to Joplin  
- `skip_sync`: Skip sync
- `bidirectional`: Bidirectional sync (default)

#### Wildcard Support

All sync rules support wildcard pattern matching:

- `*` matches any number of characters, e.g., `"Conflict*"` matches all notebooks starting with Conflict
- `?` matches a single character, e.g., `"Test?"` matches "Test1", "Test2", etc.

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "sync_rules": {
    "joplin_to_obsidian_only": ["Work Notes", "Project*"],
    "obsidian_to_joplin_only": ["Personal Diary", "Backup*"],
    "skip_sync": ["Conflict*", "Temp*", "Draft*"],
    "bidirectional": ["Important*", "Study*"]
  }
}
```

  A: Supports titles, body text, tags, attachments, folder structure, etc.
- **Q: Do I need to keep Joplin running?**
  A: Yes, and the Web Clipper service must be enabled.
- **Q: How are sync conflicts handled?**
  A: The tool automatically selects the newest version based on timestamps, avoiding manual conflict resolution.
- **Q: Can I sync only some notes?**
  A: Yes, by configuring `sync_rules` you can precisely control which notebooks sync and how.
- **Q: Will manual file deletion during program execution cause errors?**
  A: No, the program has optimized error handling to automatically skip non-existent files and continue.
- **Q: What if I encounter permission issues?**
  A: The program automatically detects permission errors and skips problematic files without interrupting the entire sync process.
- **Q: What improvements does the new duplicate detection algorithm have?**
  A: The new algorithm uses a 5-layer detection strategy with 3-5x performance improvement, more accurately detecting "same content after removing headers" duplicates.
- **Q: What if duplicate checking is too slow?**
  A: The new version has greatly optimized performance using caching and layered detection with significant speed improvements. If still slow, run `python notebridge.py test-duplicates` to view performance comparison.
- **Q: How to detect "same content after removing headers" duplicates?**
  A: The new algorithm specifically adds a 5th layer detection using advanced similarity calculation to accurately identify such duplicates.
- **Q: What if one-way sync rules don't take effect?**
  A: The latest version has fixed one-way sync rule filtering issues. The program now correctly checks sync rules for each note, ensuring only allowed direction notes are synced. If issues persist, check sync rule settings in config file.

- ✅ **Added test script**: `test_sync_rules.py` for validating sync rule logic

### Reverse Sync Problem Solution (Smart Judgment, No Manual Work)

**What is the reverse sync problem?**
- After syncing from Obsidian to Joplin, if unmodified in Joplin, shouldn't sync back to Obsidian
- After syncing from Joplin to Obsidian, if unmodified in Obsidian, shouldn't sync back to Joplin

**Smart judgment logic (automatic, no manual work):**
1. Detect note source (`notebridge_source` field)
2. Compare sync timestamps on both sides
3. **If timestamps match** → Not modified → Auto-skip
4. **If timestamps differ** → Modified → Allow sync

**Application scenarios:**
- ✅ Scenario 1: Note from Obsidian, unmodified in Joplin → **Auto-skip**
- ✅ Scenario 2: Note from Obsidian, modified in Joplin → **Allow sync**
- ✅ Scenario 3: Note from Joplin, unmodified in Obsidian → **Auto-skip**
- ✅ Scenario 4: Note from Joplin, modified in Obsidian → **Allow sync**

### Duplicate Header Problem Solution
1. **Immediate fix**: Run `python notebridge.py fix-duplicate-headers` to fix existing duplicate headers
2. **Preventive measures**:
   - Use manual confirmation mode sync: `python notebridge.py sync-manual`
   - Auto-check and fix duplicate headers before each sync
   - Regular preventive checks: `python notebridge.py prevent-duplicate-headers`
3. **Root solution**:
   - Improved sync info addition logic, thoroughly cleans old sync info
   - Added duplicate header check in `update_obsidian_note` function
   - Fixed timestamp generation logic
   - **New smart reverse sync detection**: Auto-skips unmodified reverse syncs
